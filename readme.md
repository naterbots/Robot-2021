# Robot-2021
This is a challenge I did to see if I can remake the entire @HutchinsonTigerbots-2509 2021 Robot code. It is almost midnight when I am writing this, we'll see how far I can get.

I've finished all the subsystems. I'm not sure why @CRahne thought the need to create _ZoneAnalogPosition_... but none the less I've added it.

My laptop is about to die. I've mostly completed all of the drivetrain commands and I wonder why there is no gyro based turn. I will need to add my own when I start work again.
