# Robot-2021
This is a challenge I did to see if I can remake the entire @HutchinsonTigerbots-2509 2021 Robot code. It is almost midnight when I am writing this, we'll see how far I can get.

I've finished all the subsystems. I'm not sure why @CRahne thought the need to create _ZoneAnalogPosition_... but none the less I've added it.

My laptop is about to die. I've mostly completed all of the drivetrain commands and I wonder why there is no gyro based turn. I will need to add my own when I start work again.

I've started work again and have almost completed the drivetrain commands. Next I'll start the conveyor commands, it shouldn't take me too long. Assuming there is some common sense in the original code.

The conveyor is done. I only had to make a couple of changes from what the original code had. Next I'll be working on the shooter subsystem.
